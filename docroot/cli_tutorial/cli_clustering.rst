Looking for Hypothetical Proteins in Clusters of Related Features
=================================================================

In this exercise we will look for hypothetical proteins found inside
clusters of features that routinely occur together on the chromosome. We
will postulate that these proteins perform functions related to those in
the cluster and that this provides a clue to their actual purpose.

To begin, we need to select a group of genomes and find the
functionally-coupled roles. Protein-encoding genes (pegs) that are
functionally related (e.g., enzymes from a single pathway or subunits of
a transport cassette) tend to cluster on the chromosome. Thus, if a
genome includes pegs from a pathway, they often occur close to one
another on the chromosome. When one simply looks at the genes as they
occur on a chromosome, one notices these clusters of
functionally-related pegs, and often they suggest clues to the functions
of hypothetical proteins.

To illustrate the use of p3-scripts, we will compose pipelines that
allow you to locate clusters of functionally-related genes.

The Input: a List of Pegs from a Set of Genomes
-----------------------------------------------

As input, we will start with a large set of pegs from which we will
extract possible clusters. There are many ways one can amass a set of
pegs, but let's just select a set of genomes and take the set of
features that occur in the genomes. Here we ask for all genomes of the
species Yersinia pestis, and then select for all the pegs. For each peg
we want its ID, the ID of the sequence on which it is located, its
location on that sequence, and its functional assignment.

::

    p3-all-genomes --eq "genome_name,Yersinia pestis" | p3-get-genome-features --eq feature_type,CDS --attr patric_id,sequence_id,location,product >features.tbl

This pipeline takes a while to run, but it gets us a nice large set of
features (1.5 million) from a collection of 324 distinct genomes. The
first script gets us the genome IDs; the second expands those genomes
into features. The output starts something like this.

::

    genome.genome_id    feature.patric_id   feature.sequence_id feature.location    feature.product
    385964.3    fig|385964.3.peg.1001   JMUF01000016    complement(28922..29248)    FIG002060: uncharacterized protein YggL

    385964.3    fig|385964.3.peg.101    JMUF01000001    complement(90500..90613)    hypothetical protein
    385964.3    fig|385964.3.peg.1023   JMUF01000017    complement(7081..8124)  Sucrose specific transcriptional regulator CscR, LacI family

Note that we were able to specify the output columns for
:ref:`cli::p3-get-genome-features` using a comma-delimited list of field names.
We could also have used multiple invocations of the ``--attr`` option.

::

    p3-all-genomes --eq "genome_name,Yersinia pestis" | p3-get-genome-features --eq feature_type,CDS --attr patric_id --attr sequence_id --attr location --attr product >features.tbl

The position on the contig (location column) is represented by a
leftmost position and rightmost position separated by two dots. If the
feature is on the negative strand, the entire thing is enclosed in
parentheses and preceded by the modifier ``complement``. So, for
example, ``29951..30067`` is on the positive strand from position 29951
(1-based) through position 30067. ``complement(28922..29248)`` would be
on the negative strand starting at position 29248 and ending at position
28922.

We will use this output file *features.tbl* again later, but first we
need to convert the functional assignments to roles. Most of the time, a
functional assignment is a single role; however, sometimes multiple
roles are performed by one peg. For example, a product value of

::

    Glutamate 5-kinase (EC 2.7.2.11) / RNA-binding C-terminal domain PUA

indicates that the protein contains two domains (at least), one of which
performs the role *Glutamate 5-kinase* and the other which performs the
role *RNA-binding C-terminal domain PUA*. We use the script
:ref:`cli::p3-function-to-role` to replace functions with roles. For example, if
*features.tbl* contained the lines

::

    385964.3    fig|385964.3.peg.1466   JMUF01000027    31258..31698    Hypothetical protein YaeJ with similarity to translation release factor
    385964.3    fig|385964.3.peg.1467   JMUF01000027    31783..32466    Copper homeostasis protein CutF precursor / Lipoprotein NlpE involeved in surface adhesion
    385964.3    fig|385964.3.peg.1470   JMUF01000027    complement(35126..35533)    Protein RcsF

then the command

::

    p3-function-to-role <features.tbl >feature.roles.tbl

would convert these lines to

::

    385964.3    fig|385964.3.peg.1467   JMUF01000027    31783..32466    Copper homeostasis protein CutF precursor
    385964.3    fig|385964.3.peg.1467   JMUF01000027    31783..32466    Lipoprotein NlpE involeved in surface adhesion
    385964.3    fig|385964.3.peg.1470   JMUF01000027    complement(35126..35533)    Protein RcsF

Here the hypothetical protein has been eliminated, and the multiple-role
peg has been duplicated once for each role.

In our case, we need to remove a lot more than the hypothetical
proteins: we want to restrict ourselves to roles in which we have a high
degree of confidence. You do this by specifying a *role file* that
contains information used to disambiguate substantially identical roles
and identifies the roles of interest. The data for producing these files
from the PATRIC database is still being installed; however, there is a
pre-generated file that comes with the installation package in the
**Global** subdirectory-- *subsys\_roles.tbl*. We will use this file in
:ref:`cli::p3-function-to-role`.

::

    p3-function-to-role --roles=Global/subsys_roles.tbl <features.tbl >feature.roles.tbl

The output starts like this:

::

    genome.genome_id    feature.patric_id   feature.sequence_id feature.location    feature.role
    385964.3    fig|385964.3.peg.1005   JMUF01000016    31598..31870    FIG001341: Probable Fe(2+)-trafficking protein YggX
    385964.3    fig|385964.3.peg.1046   JMUF01000017    32247..32828    Flagellar transcriptional activator FlhC
    385964.3    fig|385964.3.peg.1047   JMUF01000017    33033..33920    Flagellar motor rotation protein MotA
    385964.3    fig|385964.3.peg.1073   JMUF01000018    15496..15663    LSU ribosomal protein L33p
    385964.3    fig|385964.3.peg.1073   JMUF01000018    15496..15663    LSU ribosomal protein L33p, zinc-independent

Note that the role column replaces the product column, and remains the
last column in the file.

Creating the Clusters
---------------------

So now we have a five-column file *feature.roles.tbl* that contains
location and role information and we have a similar file containing all
the features and showing the functional assignment rather than the role.
We are going to work with the role-oriented file to compute the
clusters. We are looking for groups of roles that commonly occur
together.

Creating clusters is a two-step process: first we compute the
functionally-coupled roles (that is, roles that commonly occur close to
each other on the chromsome), then we use transitive closure to group
them into clusters. The scripts used are :ref:`cli::p3-find-couples` and
:ref:`cli::p3-generate-clusters`. This gives us the following pipe.

::

    p3-find-couples --location=location --sequence=sequence_id --col=patric_id role <feature.roles.tbl | p3-generate-clusters 1 2 >clusters.tbl

:ref:`cli::p3-find-couples` uses the feature ID as its key column. We inform the
script of this with the parameter ``--col=patric_id``. We tell it that
the coupling is to be by the roles listed in the role column with the
positional parameter ``role``. Note that even though the column name is
technically ``feature.role``, we can just specify the part after the dot
(``role``) and the column specification will still work, since there is
only the one role column in the input file.

:ref:`cli::p3-find-couples` will look up location information if necessary, but
we already have it in the input file, so we tell it to use the
``sequence_id`` column for the sequence IDs and the ``location`` column
for the feature locations. The output file contains the coupled roles in
the first two columns, so we tell :ref:`cli::p3-generate-clusters` to look in
those columns with the positional parameters (``1`` and ``2``).

The output starts like this.

The output contains one very large group plus around one hundred small
ones. We have our clusters, and we are now in a position to look for
hypothetical proteins embedded in them.

Finding the Hypotheticals
-------------------------

Our goal of finding the hypothetical proteins embedded in the role
clusters is accomplished in two steps.

#. Find the start and endpoint of each cluster in our target genomes.
#. Look inside those points for hypothetical proteins.

The script :ref:`cli::p3-identify-clusters` performs the first task. It takes as
the standard input our file of roles in the genomes
(*feature.roles.tbl*) and as a reference input the cluster file produced
by :ref:`cli::p3-generate-clusters` (*clusters.tbl*). The command is as follows.

::

    p3-identify-clusters --showRoles clusters.tbl <feature.roles.tbl >real.clusters.tbl

The output tells us which clusters were found where, and which roles
were involved. It will look something like this.

The hypothetical proteins can be found in the file *features.tbl*
generated way back at the beginning of this tutorial. We want to compare
them to the cluster locations computed above, but first we have to
extract them from the file. This is accomplished using :ref:`cli::p3-match`.

::

    p3-match --col=product "hypothetical protein" <features.tbl >hypotheticals.tbl

The result is a subset of *features.tbl* consisting only of records that
have the value ``hypothetical protein`` in the *product* column. About
296,000 proteins are filtered into the output file, which looks
something like this.

This filtered set of hypothetical proteins is fed as input to
:ref:`cli::p3-find-in-clusters`, which compares the feature locations to the
cluster locations and outputs a record if there is a match.

::

    p3-find-in-clusters --col=patric_id real.clusters.tbl <hypotheticals.tbl >clustered.hypo.tbl

Note that this could have been done with a pipeline and eschewed the

You can see a lot of features are in or near the giant cluster 1, but we
also picked up some hypotheticals crowding the smaller clusters (32 and
24). Using the :ref:`cli::p3-sort` script, we can see how many hypotheticals we
found for each cluster.

::

    p3-sort cluster_id --count <clustered.hypo.tbl

::

    cluster count
    1   83823
    10  263
    101 6
    102 18
    103 21
    104 61
    105 1
    106 6
    107 34
    108 10
    109 17
    11  827

The next step is to choose a cluster and compare the hypotheticals for
that cluster to see if any of them are substantially similar. We would
then have reason to believe the similar hypotheticals have a function
related to the cluster.
