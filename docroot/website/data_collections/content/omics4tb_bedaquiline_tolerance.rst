Omics4TB: Network analysis identifies Rv0324 and Rv0880 as regulators of bedaquiline tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
=============================================================================================================================

The resilience of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) emerges from its
ability to effectively counteract immunological, environmental and
antitubercular challenges. Here, we demonstrate that MTB can tolerate
drug treatment by adopting a tolerant state that can be deciphered
through systems analysis of its transcriptional responses. Specifically,
we demonstrate how treatment with the antitubercular drug bedaquiline
activates a regulatory network that coordinates multiple resistance
mechanisms to push MTB into a tolerant state. Disruption of this
network, by knocking out its predicted transcription factors, Rv0324 and
Rv0880, significantly increased bedaquiline killing and enabled the
discovery of a second drug, pretomanid, that potentiated killing by
bedaquiline. We demonstrate that the synergistic effect of this
combination emerges, in part, through disruption of the tolerance
network. We discuss how this network strategy also predicts drug
combinations with antagonistic interactions, potentially accelerating
the discovery of new effective combination drug regimens for
tuberculosis.

| Summary                           | Bacteria commonly adapt to        |
|                                   | stresses by altering gene         |

|                                   | to bedaquiline, we performed      |

|                                   | title). RNA was isolated and      |
|                                   | applied to custom Agilent tiled   |
|                                   | arrays. Please note that          |
|                                   | experiments were performed        |
|                                   | technically as dual channel (eg,  |
|                                   | Cy3 and Cy5-labeled samples       |
|                                   | hybridized to the same array) but |

|                                   | they are single channel (Cy3 and  |
|                                   | Cy5 signals are calculated).      |
|                                   | Therefore, there are two sample   |

|                                   | and the raw data file associated  |
