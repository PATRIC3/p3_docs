# Recorded Webinar: Proteome Comparison Service
Using PATRIC's Proteome Service to perform protein sequence-based genome comparison across a set of genomes.

## Description
The Proteome Comparison Service performs protein sequence-based genome comparison using bidirectional BLASTP. This service allows users to select up to eight genomes, either public or private, and compare them to a user-selected or supplied reference genome. The proteome comparison result is displayed as an interactive circular genome view and is downloadable as a print-quality image or tabular comparison results.This webinar provides an example analysis that demonstrates how to use the service and interpret the results.
