# Recorded Webinar: Comprehensive Genome Analysis Service
Starting with a set of reads, use PATRIC's Comprehensive Genome Analysis Service to assemble, annotate, and provide a summary analysis of the resulting annotated genome.

## Description
PATRIC’s new Comprehensive Genome Analysis Service provides a streamlined automated workflow that accepts raw reads and then performs a comprehensive analysis including assembly, annotation, identification of nearest neighbors, building a phylogenetic tree, and a basic comparative analysis that includes a subsystem summary. The service also indicates genome quality and provides quality statistics.
