Services and Tools
===================
The top-level Services Menu provides access to wide range of services and tools for analyzing data. The PATRIC private Workspace (available via registration) provides a means for accessing and securely using the services with your own data, and then interacting with your data in the context of the full PATRIC data and tools. .
