# Model Reconstruction Service

## Overview
The Model Reconstruction Service integrates and augments technologies for genome annotation, construction of gene-protein-reaction (GPR) associations, generation of biomass reactions, reaction network assembly, thermodynamic analysis of reaction reversibility, and model optimization, to generate draft genome-scale metabolic models. The service is capable of generating functioning draft metabolic models of an organism starting from an assembled genome sequence. Additional information is available in [High-throughput generation, optimization and analysis of genome-scale metabolic models](https://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v28/n9/full/nbt.1672.html).

The Metabolic Reconstruction Service can be accessed from the Services Menu at the top of the PATRIC website page and via the PATRIC Command Line Interface (CLI).
