Due to the coronavirus outbreak, the bacterial and viral worskhop originally planned for March 23-27, 2020, then tentatively rescheduled for August 24-28, 2020, has been CANCELED. Our team is working on providing the workshop materials online, and will have initial modules freely available online in October 2020. We will revisit the possibility of having in-person workshops when the outbreak has sufficiently subsided.
