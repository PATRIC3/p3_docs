# NIAID Systems Biology

The NIAID Systems Biology for Infectious Diseases Research Program develops and validates predictive models of infectious disease initiation, progression, and outcomes. These models are derived from the study of the architecture and dynamics of systems-wide host/pathogen molecular interaction networks during infection, using integrated datasets generated from a combination of “omics” technologies. The research findings will provide a deeper understanding of the overall complexity of the biological, biochemical, and biophysical molecular processes within microbial organisms as well as their interaction with the host. The programs provide data and reagents that result from the research conducted and provide training for the broader infectious disease scientific community to promote the use of the systems biology approach.

Data from the new [Omics4TB](http://www.omics4tb.org/) project will be included at PATRIC and accessible from the page below as it is released.

## Systems biology work specific to antibacterial resistance:

The following systems biology projects use a multi-disciplinary systems biology approach to study the molecular interaction networks of the pathogen and the host in association with antibacterial resistance or in response to treatment of antibacterial resistant infections.
