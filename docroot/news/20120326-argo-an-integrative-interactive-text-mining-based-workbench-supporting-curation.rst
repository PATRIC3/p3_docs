**Abstract**

Curation of biomedical literature is often supported by the automatic
analysis of textual content that generally involves a sequence of
individual processing components. Text mining (TM) has been used to
enhance the process of manual biocuration, but has been focused on
specific databases and tasks rather than an environment integrating TM
tools into the curation pipeline, catering for a variety of tasks, types
of information and applications. Processing components usually come from
different sources and often lack interoperability. The well established
Unstructured Information Management Architecture is a framework that
addresses interoperability by defining common data structures and
interfaces. However, most of the efforts are targeted towards software
developers and are not suitable for curators, or are otherwise
inconvenient to use on a higher level of abstraction. To overcome these
issues we introduce Argo, an interoperable, integrative, interactive and
collaborative system for text analysis with a convenient graphic user
interface to ease the development of processing workflows and boost
productivity in labour-intensive manual curation. Robust, scalable text
analytics follow a modular approach, adopting component modules for
distinct levels of text analysis. The user interface is available
entirely through a web browser that saves the user from going through
often complicated and platform-dependent installation procedures. Argo
comes with a predefined set of processing components commonly used in
text analysis, while giving the users the ability to deposit their own
components. The system accommodates various areas and levels of user
expertise, from TM and computational linguistics to ontology-based
curation. One of the key functionalities of Argo is its ability to
seamlessly incorporate user-interactive components, such as manual
annotation editors, into otherwise completely automatic pipelines. As a
use case, we demonstrate the functionality of an in-built manual
annotation editor that is well suited for in-text corpus annotation
tasks.
