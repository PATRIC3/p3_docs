PATRIC User Guides
===================

The PATRIC website provides an entry point to integrated data and tools
for bacterial infectious disease research. The website is organized by
data types and analysis tools. These user guides serve as a reference to
each of the tools and services including what they do, where they are located
and each of their features.
